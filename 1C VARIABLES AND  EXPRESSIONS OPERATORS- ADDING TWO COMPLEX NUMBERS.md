# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - write a program to find speed of the car to cover the given distance(km) and time(hr).
## AIM
To write a Python program to calculate the speed of a car based on the given distance and time.

## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.

2.Prompt the user to input distance (in km) and time (in hr).

3.Calculate speed using the formula speed = distance / time.

4.Display the calculated speed.
## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222040145
#Name-SANJAI T
#Write your code here
dist=float(input())
time=float(input())
speed=dist/time
print("Speed is {:.2f}km/hr".format(speed))

```
